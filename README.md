# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Zomato Data Analysis project using Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

#1. Data Analysis Project using Python 

"This project analyzes Zomato's customer and restaurant data to uncover insights into customer preferences, restaurant types, and spending habits."

"The analysis aims to help understand factors such as ratings, votes, and ordering modes, providing actionable insights for improving customer experience."


#2. Zomato Data Analysis: Insights into Customer Behavior and Restaurant Performance

1. What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?

2. How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?

3. What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?

4. Zomato has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their average spending on each order?

5. Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?

6. Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Zomato can provide those customers with some good offers?

3. #Technologies Used:

1. Python: for data analysis and processing
